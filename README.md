# Le avventure di Cassius / Cassius' adventures 

## What is it??
This is my first collab project made with some of my friends in high school. This was actually one of the biggest and hardest project I've done so far. It's a game made for a
school assignment and we had 1 month to create something, we went all-in with a crazy ASCII project in x86 assembly.\
The entire game is written in italian and, with it, it comes more than 20 files that the program needs to load all the scenes. This project **is not optimized at all**, it comes as it is, with just one month of work. ðŸ˜„

For any game suggestion you can contact me directly francescomaca93@gmail.com!

## How to use it??
To play the game you can download the zip file and the .asm. Once you've downloaded the file you need to use also download Emu8086 from [this](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/download) link. Now you have the prerequisites to run the game.
